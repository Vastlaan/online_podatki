  services_body: `Income tax settlement before the office a few years ago was easier and faster,
          it was enough to have documents from the employer.
          However, in recent years, the tax offices have introduced several changes allowing a more detailed analysis of each submitted application.
          Unfortunately, the consequence of these changes is the need to have additional documents and
          in many cases also a longer waiting time for the payment of funds due to the taxpayer.
          That is why we help in difficult situations, represent clients in contacts with institutions, advise and provide linguistic assistance.`,
